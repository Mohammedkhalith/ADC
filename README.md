# ADC
The ADC temperature sensing project uses an LM35 sensor to measure temperature and display it on a 16×2 LCD. The LM35 gives an analog voltage proportional to temperature. The microcontroller’s ADC converts this analog signal into digital data, calculates the temperature in °C, and shows the real-time value on the LCD display.
